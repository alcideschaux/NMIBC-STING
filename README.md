# NMIBC-STING

## Exploratory data analysis
Including all cases, with and without BCG treatment:

- [Descriptive statistics](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-01-DESCRIPTIVE.ipynb): clinicopathologic and outcome features, marker expression (STING, cGAS, pIRF3, PD-L1, FOXP3, CD8, CD8-Ki67)
- [Correlation analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-02-CORRELATION.ipynb): correlation between markers
- [Outcome analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-04-OUTCOME.ipynb): marker expression by stage and grade, marker expression by tumor recurrence and tumor progression (grade and stage), at next biopsy and at any biopsy
- [BCG analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-03-BCG.ipynb): in patients with BCG treatment, marker expression pre and post BCG treatment. In patients without BCG treatment, marker expression according to TURB sequence.
- [Survival analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-05-SURVIVAL.ipynb): Survival curves for tumor recurrence and tumor progression (grade and stage) by low/high level marker expression.

## Patients with BCG treatment
- [Descriptive statistics](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/BCG-01-DESCRIPTIVE.ipynb): clinicopathologic and outcome features, marker expression (STING, cGAS, pIRF3, PD-L1, FOXP3, CD8, CD8-Ki67)
