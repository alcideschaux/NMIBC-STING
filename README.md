# NMIBC-STING

## Exploratory data analysis
Including all cases, with and without BCG treatment:

- [Descriptive statistics](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-01-DESCRIPTIVE.ipynb): clinicopathologic and outcome features, marker expression (STING, cGAS, pIRF3, PD-L1, FOXP3, CD8, CD8-Ki67).
- [Correlation analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-02-CORRELATION.ipynb): correlation between markers.
- [Outcome analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-04-OUTCOME.ipynb): marker expression by stage and grade, marker expression by tumor recurrence and tumor progression (grade and stage), at next biopsy and at any biopsy.
- [BCG analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-03-BCG.ipynb): in patients with BCG treatment, marker expression pre and post BCG treatment. In patients without BCG treatment, marker expression according to TURB sequence.
- [Survival analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/EDA-05-SURVIVAL.ipynb): Survival curves for tumor recurrence and tumor progression (grade and stage) by low/high level marker expression.

## Patients with BCG treatment
- [Descriptive statistics](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/BCG-01-DESCRIPTIVE.ipynb): clinicopathologic and outcome features, marker expression (STING, cGAS, pIRF3, PD-L1, FOXP3, CD8, CD8-Ki67).
- [Outcome analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/BCG-02-OUTCOME.ipynb): marker expression by tumor recurrence and tumor progression (grade and stage), at next biopsy and at any biopsy, in patients who received BCG treatment.

## Naïve-treatment cases
- [Descriptive statistics](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/TURB-01-DESCRIPTIVE.ipynb): marker expression in patients who had not received yet therapy (TURB = 0).
- [Outcome analysis](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/TURB-02-OUTCOME.ipynb): marker expression by stage, grade, tumor recurrence and tumor progression (grade and stage), at next biopsy and at any biopsy, who had not received yet therapy (TURB = 0).

## Cases treated with mitomycin and BCG
- [Descriptive statistics](https://github.com/alcideschaux/NMIBC-STING/blob/master/MMC.ipynb): marker expression in patients who had received mitomycin therapy by BCG treatment.
